In agriculture, precision farming powered by AI can help Indian farmers optimize crop yields and manage water resources more efficiently. Furthermore, AI can revolutionize education through personalized learning platforms, making quality education accessible to millions.\n",

Ensuring that the workforce is reskilled to thrive in an AI-driven economy is a monumental task. Additionally, issues related to data privacy, ethical AI, and the digital divide must be addressed to ensure that the benefits of AI are equitably distributed.\n",
